# Schedule
## Guiding Lights
- I want to live a life of learning
  - I want to learn mathematics, physics, logic, computer science
- To do so I will have to accumulate wealth to free myself / my family
  - Current societal structures place freedom (+ quality of life) at an extremely high cost
    - Estimate this cost ~7MM (approx. 1M for general spending) equates to approx. 350k
- Ways to generate wealth
  - Wage-slaving
    - Quant Trading (this is the only feasible way IMO)
  - Founding (I prefer this)
  - Trading?
    - Potentially? This would make sense as a general habit (i.e tracking financial markets + movements)
  - **notice**
    - I'd prefer to sell a company for 7MM over 5 yrs. rather than wage-slaving + making that over 5 yrs.
## September Goals
 - Get to a solid point in analysis
   - I.e fundamentally understand concepts necessary to develop expertise in ML
   - Also fundamentally understand concepts necessary to understand modern trading strategies?
 - Get to a solid point in consensus research
## Mon Sep. 4
- Mathematics
  - Start on topology exercises
- Consensus
  - Finish architecture chapter in Van Steen's book
## Tus. Sep. 5
- Got back from work at ~8
  - Took nap until 930, showered until 10
- Mathematics (finish topology chapter)
- Consensus (backlog from yday)
